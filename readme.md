# Dev/Iowa Telescope

The Dev/Iowa Telescope a child of the first ever Dev/Iowa Hackathon. Via a HTML Page take an image, overlay the Dev/Iowaw logo, uploads the photo to a twitter account and reloads the webpage to show you the photo you just took.

It has the following requirements:

1. A Raspberry Pi with camera module and network connection.
2. Knowledge of python or williness to learn.
3. ImageMagick Dependences installed on your Raspberry Pi.
4. A Twiiter Developer account for API uploading.

The Raspberry Pi can be ran as a local network web server if you run the following command on the directiory:

'''
python -m CGIHTTPServer
'''

This makes the Telescope fantastic for having others on the network take picture.
